Steps for solving the assignment:
1. run "cargo run solve"
    1. Ask for the required card properties using "getYourNftCardProperties"
    2. Parse the card properties into a hex string
    3. Query for the list of NFTs using "nftSupply"
    4. Find the nonce of required card
    5. Deploy a modified version of the assignment SC, that has the "sendNftToOwner" endpoint, 
        which will send into my wallet the nft with the requested nonce.
    6. Create an NFT with the required properties using "createNftWithAttributes"
2. view the token id of the received NFT in the MultiversX wallet dashboard
3. put the token id and the nonce obtained at 1.4 in the "execute_swap()" function
4. run "cargo run swap"
    1. Exchange the NFT that I created with the assignment SC NFT
